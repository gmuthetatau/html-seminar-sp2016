          <h3 class="sectiontitle">Step 1. Connect to the Mason server</h3>
          <p>This is probably the hardest part of tonight. If you can get past this, the rest of this will be a breeze!</p>
          <p>When you visit a website, your browser downloads a special file called an "HTML" file and displays it. In this class, we will be creating these files and transfering them to the Mason server. Once you do this, you will be able to visit <a href="http://mason.gmu.edu/~netid/">http://mason.gmu.edu/~netid/</a> and see your webpage!</p>
          <p>So we need to start by learning how to transfer files to the Mason server.</p>
          <h4>Step 1a. Microsoft Windows</h4>
          <p>If you're using Microsoft Windows, you will need to download a program to transfer files to the Mason server. We suggest that you download and install <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>.</p>
          <h4>Step 1b. Apple Macintosh OS X</h4>
          <p>If you're using Apple Macintosh OS X, you will need to download a program to transfer files to the Mason server. We suggest that you download and install <a href="https://cyberduck.io/">Cyberduck</a>. (NOTE: We know that OS X comes with the <code>scp</code> program for transfering files via the Terminal.)</p>
          <p>Once you've installed Cyberduck, open Cyberduck.</p>
          <img src="img/mac/1.jpg" />
          <p>Click <strong>Open Connection</strong>, and make sure <strong>SFTP (SSH File Transfer Protocol)</strong> is selected from the dropdown. In the box for <strong>Server</strong>, enter <code>mason.gmu.edu</code> and make sure the <strong>Port</strong> is 22. In the box labeled <strong>Username</strong>, enter your NetID. Enter your GMU Password in the box labeled <strong>Password</strong>. If you've forgotten your password, you can <a href="https://password.gmu.edu/">reset your Patriot Pass password</a>. Once you've verified that your information is correct, click <strong>Connect</strong>.</p>
          <img src="img/mac/2.jpg" />
          <p></p>
          <img src="img/mac/3.jpg" />
          <img src="img/mac/4.jpg" />
          <img src="img/mac/5.jpg" />
          <h4>Step 1c. Linux</h4>
          <p>If you're using Linux, you probably have everything you need already!</p>
          <p>Open Files, and click <strong>File</strong> > <strong>Connect to Server</strong>.</p>
          <p>In the Server Address box, type <code>sftp://netid@mason.gmu.edu/home/netid</code> and click Connect. Remember to replace <em>netid</em> with your NetID (e.g., <em>ksarkhel</em> is my NetID).</p>

            <h3 class="sectiontitle">Step 1.5. Setting up your home directory</h3>
            <p>Now that you're logged into your account on the Mason cluster,
            we need to ensure that your home directory is set up properly to
            host a web page.</p>

            <p>In order to serve HTML files to your public webpage, Mason
            relies on the existence of a directory named 'public_html' inside
            your home directory. To create this directory, right click in the
            Cyberduck window and select <strong>New Folder</strong>, then type
            <code>public_html</code>.</p>

            <!-- image here -->

            <p>Within this directory you will place all the HTML files that you
            want people to be able to see, including the ones we make during
            this class. Let's go ahead and make a test homepage.</p>

            <p>Open a basic text editor and create a new file (<u>notepad</u>
            on Windows, <u>TextEdit</u> on Mac, or <u>gedit</u> on Linux). 
            In this file, type whatever you want - keep it short for now, such
            as your name, or a sentence. Then save the file with the name
            <code>index.html</code>.</p>
            
            <p>
            <em>On Windows, you must select <strong>File</strong> &gt;
            <strong>Save As...</strong> and select 
            <u>All Files (*)</u> from the drop-down list at the
            bottom of the dialog box, then enter <strong>index.html</strong> as
            the file name. <br />
            On Mac using TextEdit, make sure <strong>File Format</strong> is
            set to <strong>Web Page (.html)</strong> and enter
            <code>index</code> in the <strong>Save As:</strong> field.<br />
            <em>Failure to follow those steps may result in a file with a name
            like <code>index.html.txt</code>, which will not work.</em>
            </p>

            <p>Now we're going to upload the file you made to your home
            directory on Mason, inside the <code>public_html</code> directory
            we made earlier. To do that, simply drag the file from wherever you
            saved it on your local computer to inside your SFTP window,
            ensuring it lands inside the <code>public_html</code> folder.</p>

            <!-- image here -->

            <p>Now let's open your internet browser and go to your Mason
            webpage. The URL is <code>mason.gmu.edu/~netid</code> (where
            <code>netid</code> is your GMU username - the same one you logged
            in with earlier).</p>
            
            <hr />
            <p>If you are setting up web access for the first time, you may
            get an error page <strong>403 Forbidden</strong>:</p>

            <!-- image here -->

            <p>If this is the case, it is because the <code>public_html</code>
            directory you created had its permissions set by default to
            disallow others from viewing the files inside. To fix this in
            Cyberduck, right-click on the <code>public_html</code> folder and
            click <strong>Info</strong>. Then click the
            <strong>Permissions</strong> tab at the top of the window. Your
            permissions should be set to <em>Read</em>, <em>Write</em> and
            <em>Execute</em> for <strong>Owner</strong>, and 
            <em>Execute</em> for <strong>Group</strong> and
            <strong>Others</strong>. The <em>Execute</em> permission flag
            enables other people to list the files in your
            <code>public_html</code> directory. You do NOT want <em>Write</em>
            permissions for <strong>Group</strong> or <strong>Other</strong>;
            otherwise, anyone would be able to modify your files!
            To verify you have the correct permissions, check that the
            <strong>Unix Permissions</strong> box reads <em>711</em> or
            <em>755</em>.</p>
            <hr />

            <p>
            Once you have the correct permissions, refresh the
            page in your internet browser and you should see the sentence you
            typed earlier into your <code>index.html</code> file.
            Congratulations! You are now ready to make your own website on the
            Mason cluster!
            </p>

            </div>
            <div class="col-md-9">
              <p>Lists are a useful way to organize information. For example, you could put a list of classes you've taken or a shopping list on your webpage. You can either have an unordered list (just bullet points) or an ordered list (where each item is enumerated 1, 2, 3,&hellip; and so on). We'll start with unordered lists.</p>
            </div>
          </div>
          <p>Start by adding the following code to your HTML file.</p>
          <pre>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bred&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Egs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Dog&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;</pre>
          <p>The text between the <code>&lt;li&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/li&gt;</code> tags are called the <b><u>l</u></b>ist <b><u>i</u></b>tem tags. The <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> starts an <b><u>u</u></b>nordered <b><u>l</u></b>ist in which you can put list item tags. When you reload your browser, you should see the following:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Bred</li>
            <li>Egs</li>
            <li>A Dog</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Try adding another list item that says <code>Hello, List!</code>.</p>
          <p>Once you've done that, change the <code>&lt;ul&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ul&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;ol&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;/ol&lt;</code> respectively. Once you've done that it should look like this when you reload the browser.</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Milk</li>
            <li>Bred</li>
            <li>Egs</li>
            <li>A Dog</li>
            <li>Hello, List!</li>
          </ol>
          <p>If your browser doesn't look like this, make sure your code looks like the following:</p>
          <pre>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Milk&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bred&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Egs&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A Dog&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Hello, List!&lt;/li&gt;

			<p>Once I graduate from Mason I have a few goals (both academic and personal) that I plan on achieving. </p>
			<h4>Academic</h4>

				<li>Work for the NSA. Ideally, I would like to intern with them of participate in a Co-Op, but we'll see where
				that goes.</li>
					
	            <li>Work for a private, government contracting company. Or build my own.</li>
	            <li>Be a master at many different coding languages</li>
	            <li>Learn to 'hack', ethically of course</li>

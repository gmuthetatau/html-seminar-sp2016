			<ul>
				<li>CS 105</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Description: Computer Ethics Course</li>
						<li>Teacher: Chris Kauffman</li>
						<li>Easiness (1 easy - 10 hard): 7. There's way too much reading.</li>
						<li>Interest: Not very. I could care less about computer ethics.</li>
					</ul>
	            <li>CS 112</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Description: Into to Computer Programming. Basically just learning Python</li>
						<li>Teacher: Yutao Zhong. Yea, I can't pronounce it either.</li>
						<li>Easiness (1 easy - 10 hard): 3. Python is easy. Tests and Quizzes are confusing.</li> 
						<li>Interest: Really interested. The class itself is boring, but I like doing the projects.</li>
					</ul>
	            <li>CS 101</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Description: Preview of Computer Science</li>
						<li>Teacher: Zoran Durich</li>
						<li>Easiness (1 easy - 10 hard): 3. The lectures are good, and we don't do much outside work. However, I'm
						not sure how hard the Robotics project will be.</li>
						<li>Interest: Medium. Some of the topics we discuss in class are pretty interesting.</li>
					</ul>
	            <li>Math 113</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Description: Calculus I</li>
						<li>Teacher: Kumnit Nong.</li>
						<li>Easiness (1 easy - 10 hard): 8. To be fair, I got a 100% on the first exam. However, the class average
						right now is like 60%, so needless to say, the class is hard.</li>
						<li>Interest: Definitely interested. I like math, but only when I understand it.</li>
					</ul>
	            <li>Honors 122</li>
					<ul>
						<li>Description: Reading the Arts with a focus in historical photographic manipulation.</li>
						<li>Teacher: Heather Anderson (Awesome)</li>
						<li>Easiness (1 easy - 10 hard): 8. The class itself is just a lecure. We have lots of readings, that tend to
						be very long and hard to comprehend. The real reason for the 8 is all the papers we have to write. The research
						paper due at the end of the year is going to be a pain<li>
						<li>Interest: Kind of. The teacher and the stuff we are learning in class is cool. But I would not have taken
						this class unless I was forced to.</li>
					</ul>
